    "This notebook will show you how easy it is to use gdeep to reproduce the experiments of the paper [Topology of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06093.pdf), by Naizat et. al. In this work, the authors studied the evolution of the topology of a dataset as embedded in the successive layers of a Neural Network, trained for classification on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their main findings can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural networks tend to simplify the topology of the dataset accross layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This decrease in topological complexity is more efficient when the activation functions are non-homeomorphic, as it is the case for ReLu or leakyReLu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an illustration from the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "![illustration](/notebook_images/tda_dl/intro.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of this tutorial will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the Entangled Tori dataset.\n",
    "2. Build several fully connected networks, with different activation functions.\n",
    "3. Train these networks to classify the Entangled Tori datasets.\n",
    "4. Visualise in tensorboard the persistence diagrams of the dataset embedded in each layers of each network.\n",
    "5. Study the decrease in topological complexity of the dataset accross layers\n",
