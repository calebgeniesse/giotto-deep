    "#### Author: Matteo Caorsi\n",
    "\n",
    "This short tutorial shows you how to use the basic functioning of *giotto-deep* API for an imagee classfication task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classifcation is about associating a picture with a label: for example, you would like your model to be able to associate a label `cat` to the image of a cat and a label `dog`to an image of a dog:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./images/image_class.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to clarify that the set of labels has to be pre-defined and the modls have to be trained with a sufficient amount of data per label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of the tutorial are the following:\n",
    " 1. creation of a dataset\n",
    " 2. creation of a model\n",
    " 3. define metrics and losses\n",
    " 4. run benchmarks\n",
